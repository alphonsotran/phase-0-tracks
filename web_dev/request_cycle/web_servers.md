In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
VPS is a server that is created by a computer virtually in the machine.

The advantages of using a VPS is that it's cheaper than a physical private server; it can be customized to your own needs; you don't have to pay for excessive resources; and you have a lot more control than shared hosting.

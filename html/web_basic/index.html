  <p>Is this <em>really</em> a test? It's kinda hard to tell. You can <a href="https://www.google.com">google</a> it of course, but I don't think that'll help you much.</p>
  <p>You can also try any of the methods below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask your significant other if this is a test.</li>
    <li>Or if significant other doesn't exist, ask your friend (if you have one).</li>
    <li>Enroll in a philosophy course hoping that you'll develop the critical skills to determine the answer.</li>
    <li>Ask mom.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Really though, you shouldn't be wasting your time reading this page. Here is what you should do to get out of this dilemma.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Move your mouse cursor to the red circle (Mac) or X (Windows) and click on it.</li>
    <li><strong>Shut down computer</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

    Version control is the ability to view the entire history of a file or files. These can be already merged and would let us know the people who changed them. This is useful because it gives us more control to a file as well as the ability to go back in the file's "past" to fix errors. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

    Branch is a copy of the master branch in a repo. It allows us to make changes to a file without affecting the master file and then later, after review, able to merge with the master. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

    Commit is considered a save point in git. It has a unique ID, message, author, and a timestamp. A good commit message contains detailed messages about the changes made compared to the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

    A merge conflict happens when one merges code from the current branch to a master branch. These are conflicts in the code that git is unable to resolve itself. This usually happens because the master branch diverges.
